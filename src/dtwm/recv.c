 *                     NOTE: THIS MUST HAVE A XmNconvertCallback RESOURCE!
 *                 client_type - The type of client we are.
 *                 request_callback - The callback call when a message
 *                                    is received.

 *	Returns: True if no one currently owns the selection and I have
 *               taken ownership.
 * 
 * NOTE: The reply that is filled in by the application programmer is
 *       passed to FreeReply, so that memory may be freed.  If you
